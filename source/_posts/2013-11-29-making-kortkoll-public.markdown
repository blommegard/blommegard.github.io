In the begining of the summer, at [Stockholm Startup Hack](http://www.sthlmstartuphack.com/) me, [@peterssonjesper](http://twitter.com/peterssonjesper), [@gellermark](http://twitter.com/gellermark) and [@wibron](http://twitter.com/wibron) created a hack called Kortkoll. It is an app that shows information about your [SL](http://sl.se/) Access Card.  

It is an iOS7+ only app and my playground for testing out new features in the iOS SDK. I have now decided to put the source up at [github](https://github.com/Kortkoll/kortkoll-ios) for everyone to have a look at. Maybe you learn something by it, or you find some nasty peace of code in there. Either way, ping me about it! :)

The app itself is programmed by me and all beautiful pixels are produced by [gellermark](http://dribbble.com/gellermark).
